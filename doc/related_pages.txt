/** 
 * \page docu Informations to the Documentation
 * 
 * This documentation is based on the grouping of the functions in phist, which can be found under Modules 
 * in the bar above. So take a look there to get a description of the functions.
 *
 * The main groups are:
 * - core: Common functionality for iterative solvers <br>
 *          (includes definition of a linear operator, orthogonalization routines, factorization methods for small dense matrices,...)
 * - jada: Jacobi-Davidson method and tools
 * - kernels: Kernel function interface <br>
 *          (includes functions for matrix and vector operations, communication operations, ...)
 * - krylov: Krylov subspace methods <br>
 *          (includes linear solvers like blocked GMRES, blocked BICGStab,...)
 * - precon: Preconditioning interface
 * - tools: Utility functions and macros <br>
 *          (includes enumerations, a random number generator, ...)
 * - C++ bindings for PHIST
 *
 *
 * \section phist_Xfunction_name
 *
 * PHIST currently supports four data types for scalar values:
 * - Single precision real (S)
 * - Double precision real (D)
 * - single precision Complex (C)
 * - double precision complex (Z)
 *
 * Macros are used to implement functions for multiple data types.<br>
 * By including the phist_gen_ **X** .h header, followed by the type-generic declaration
 * (_decl) or definition (_def) file, we generate the functions for a specific type **X** 
 * out of S,D,C and Z. The functions are then called phist_Sfunction_name, phist_Dfunction_name,...
 * depending on **X**.
 *
 * To provide, having the same function documented for each data type, we write **phist_Xfunction_name**
 * in the documentation if you can choose between different data types in the function function_name of phist.
 *
 * Analogeously we write **phist_Xtype_name** for such types of phist.
