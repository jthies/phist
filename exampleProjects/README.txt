This folder contains examples on how to use a phist installation
in an external project using different build systems. Right now we
demonstrate this for CMake and PkgConfig. To see how these projects are built
see phist/buildScripts/test_install.sh, which is executed by issuing the command 
'make test_install' in the phist build directory.
