PHIST - a Pipelined Hybrid Parallel Iterative Solver Toolkit
============================================================

Disclaimer
==========

This is a pre-alpha release, so **please do not expect anything to work!** Just 
kidding... But some things may, and probably will, be broken.
Nevertheless, please report any bugs, issues and feature requests to the [issue 
tracker](https://bitbucket.org/essex/phist/issues).


What is PHIST?
==============

The `Pipelined Hybrid-parallel Iterative Solver Toolkit' was developed as a
sparse iterative solver framework within the ESSEX project (Equipping Sparse Solvers for Exascale).
The aim of PHIST is to provide an environment for developing iterative solvers for sparse linear 
systems and eigenvalue problems that can tackle the challenges of today's increasingly complex CPUs and
arithmetic coprocessors.

The git repository can be checked out using the command

  git clone git@bitbucket.org:essex/phist
