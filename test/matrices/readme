*) GMRES, no preconditioning. JDQR basically works (I tested only the cry10000 matrix, 
thogugh) with a direct solver, but the JD iteration stagnates at times and does not achieve
more than 10^-6 or something like that. It helps to use shift-invert at the beginning rather
than RQI, and not do Arnoldi steps because we have huge dominant negative eigenvalues and 
the sought ones are relatively small.
