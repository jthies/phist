Directory matlab/ contains some matlab prototypes of the target
algorithms of this project. This is not to be confused with a matlab
interface to the actual libraries. The prototypes are simple, serial 
and unoptimized and should only be used for testing the numerics and
'playing around' with some algorithmic details.

The codes work with matlab R2012b and we aim to have them running under 
octave as well.
