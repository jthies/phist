======================
needRestart() function
======================
This function checks if it is the 1st-run or a restarted run. It is especially useful in case of nested checkpoints, where the inner-level checkpoints need not to read every time.

  CRAFT ENV. PARAMETERS 
=======================

        VARIABLE          DEFAULT         DISCRIPTION 

CRAFT_CP_READ_ON_RESTART    1             Set 0 to disable. Thus, CP will not be read. (needRestart will return false and read() will return immediately too.) by default it is enabled. 

CRAFT_ENABLE                1             Set 0 to disable. No checkpoints will be taken.

CRAFT_USE_SCR               1(true)       Set 0(false) to disable. If CRAFT is build with SCR, this flag can be used to disbale its usage in the application. Thus checkponts will be created on PFS.

CRAFT_CP_PATH               "./"          Path to checkpoint in case of PFS-level checkpoints.
