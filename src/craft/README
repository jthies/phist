===== ABOUT =====
This library provides an easier interface to introduce Checkpoint/Restart and Automatic Fault Tolerance(AFT) capabilities in your program.
AFT-option can only be used if compliled with ULFM-MPI.


===== Supported types and features =====

1) POD (double, int, float etc.)
2) POD Arrays
3) GHOST: ghost_densemat
4) PHIST: Mvec, SdMat 


===== REQUIREMENTS =====
1) Requires MPI

===== INSTALLATION =====
1) mkdir install; cd install
2) env CC=mpicc CXX=mpiCC ccmake ../
 Provide CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. Configure according to your requirements. 
3) make; make install


===== USAGE ===== 
1) A Checkpoint object can be initialized by giving it a unique name, and an MPI-communicator.
2) Various objects can be added to by called .add function and giving the appropriate parameters.
3) Other Checkpoint objects can be added at different levels of the program.

The directory-structure of the program looks like this.
CPBASEPATH:

	|	
	-----Checkpoint-CP1			
			|	
			-----v-2/a.ckpt, b.ckpt	
			-----v-3/a.ckpt, b.ckpt	
			-----metadata.ckpt	
	|	
	-----Checkpoint-CP2
			|	
			-----v-5/x.ckpt, y.ckpt	
			-----v-6/	
			----metadata.ckpt
